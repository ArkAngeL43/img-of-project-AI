# Further note 

all scripts in here are mine, all scripts used and imbedded are mine, all databases are mine, only thign would be the login system in which that is a system that belonged to a very very old repo that i recreated to my standards and scripts, so i will not call it my own since the older author made 50% of the script where i changed and or/ edited the script again to my standards

# last note

 this propgram uses realistic male and female AI Voice, and has over 100+ files for responses to inputs and outputs for live sessions on network monitoring, i hope to release this soon | im considering not doing that since this is a very large project built around my personal needs and is way to much to change everything if i do i would say the release will be in december 5th 2021 
 
 1: stay at 127.0.0.1

2: wear a 255.255.255.0

3: :D love to all
